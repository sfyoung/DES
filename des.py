I want write some python3 program for my cryptological schoolwork.
This program is write for this purpose. It's about DES cry-
ptological algorithm. So if you know something about DES,
you can understand it very easily. Have fun!

3.python source code:pyDes-2.0.1
XUbuntu: 12.04.2 LTS, Kenrel: 3.2.0-24-generic,Python: Python 3.2.3
pad:PKCS #5
mode: ECB

How To use:
At first, please remember the precondition: padding mode is PKCS #5, encrypt model is ECB, and run this module on python3.
class Des
init method:des.Des(message, key, crypt)
message:    the source text that you want to encrypt or decrypt
key:        your key that you want to use to encrypt or decrypt. You have to ensure it is 8 bits long.
crypt:      'en' to encrypt or 'de' to decrypt, default is 'en'

main method: des.Des.crpyt()
This method can do encrypt or decrypt(by crypt = 'en' or crypt = 'de')

eg:
from des import *
message = b'hello, world'
key = b'ILoveYou'
c = Des(message, key, 'en').crypt()
print('c = %s' %c)
#You will see
#c = b'\xaa\xc6xz^\xf8\xc2<\xa1\xd4\xefU\x1f\x1c<$'
p = Des(c, key, 'de').crypt()
print('p = %s' %p)
#You will see
#p = b'hello, world'
